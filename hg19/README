====================== Melbourne Genomics Variant Calling Pipeline =======================

This is the directory where the pipeline expects to find reference data.

Most reference data is downloaded from the GATK resource bundle. For more information on
the GATK resource bundle, see this post:

http://gatkforums.broadinstitute.org/discussion/1213/what-s-in-the-resource-bundle-and-how-can-i-get-it

To actually download the files, simply paste the following URL into your browser:

  ftp://gsapubftp-anonymous@ftp.broadinstitute.org/bundle/2.8/hg19

In fact, we only rely on small parts of the resource bundle so you should only download specific files:

    dbsnp_138.hg19.vcf
    dbsnp_138.hg19.vcf.idx
    Mills_and_1000G_gold_standard.indels.hg19.vcf
    Mills_and_1000G_gold_standard.indels.hg19.vcf.idx
    ucsc.hg19.dict
    ucsc.hg19.fasta
    ucsc.hg19.fasta.fai

These will be zipped on FTP site, so you need to unzip them (tar -xzf <file>) after downloading.

Finally, the reference FASTA needs to be indexed:

    bwa index -a bwtsw ucsc.hg19.fasta

(Expect this to take anywhere from 10 minutes to an hour depending on your computer)
        

NOTE: for genome in a bottle comparisons, the file na12878_na12877_bwa_gatk3.vcf 
may be downloaded on 17 Feb 2015 from 

ftp://ussd-ftp.illumina.com/IlluminaPlatinumGenomes_v7.0/individual_callsets/
